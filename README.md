# A Comprehensive Note on Machine Learning

## Introduction

This document serves as an educational resource primarily designed for the courses I teach, including:

- **CSE 474/574 Introduction to Machine Learning**
- **CSE 455/555 Pattern Recognition**
- **CSE 676 Deep Learning**

Additionally, it functions as a personal reference in the field of machine learning.
