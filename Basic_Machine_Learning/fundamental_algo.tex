\chapter{Fundamental Algorithms}
In this chapter, we will go through popular machine learning algorithms. In general, machine learning algorithms that are the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) such as image recognition, speech recognition, recommendation systems, ranking and personalization of content. They aren't generally designed to infer the underlying \textit{generative process} (e.g., to model something), but rather to predict or classify with the most accuracy.

\section{Three Basic Algorithms}
We will first provide you with basic tools to use, so we will start the simple three \textit{linear regression, k-nearest neighbors}, and \textit{k-means}.

\subsection{Linear Regression}
When you use it, you are making the assumption that there is a \textit{linear} relationship between an outcome variable (sometimes also called the response vairable, dependent variable, or label) and a predictor (sometimes also called an independent variable, explanatory variable, or feature); or between one variable and several other variables, in which case you're \textit{modeling} the relationship as having a linear structure.
